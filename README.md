# Flux

## Description
Flux is a custom-built bytecode interpreter currently under development. This project is designed to deepen my understanding of interpreters and bytecode execution.

## Usage
To compile `.flux` file, use the following command:<br>
```sh
./FluxCompiler [filename].flux<br>
```
This command generates a `Gen.cflx` file.<br>

To interpret, use the following command:<br>
```sh
./FluxInt Gen.cflx
```

## Future plans:
1. Functions, maybe even structs.<br>
2. Optimizing Compiler and Interpreter.<br>
