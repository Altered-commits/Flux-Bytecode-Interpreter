### Flux

**Description:** <br>
Flux is a custom-built bytecode interpreter currently under development. I am creating it as a part of my own project.

**Usage:** <br>
To compile, use the following command:<br>
./FluxCompiler [filename].txt<br>
->This command generates a `generated.flx` file.<br>

To interpret, use the following command:<br>
./FluxInt generated.flx<br>

**Future plans:** <br>
-Loops, Conditions, Functions, maybe even structs.<br>
-Optimizing Compiler and Interpreter.<br>
